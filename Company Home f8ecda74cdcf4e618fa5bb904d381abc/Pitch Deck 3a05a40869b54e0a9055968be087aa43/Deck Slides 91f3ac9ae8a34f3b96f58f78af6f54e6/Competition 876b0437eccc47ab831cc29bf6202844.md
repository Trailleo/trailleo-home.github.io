Things to write: 1. Trekking companies in india. - advantage we have - they cater to only few set of treks where they have operations, their information is not well organised and is difficult to understand. They are more involved into their own operations
2. Outdoor navigation companies in US,europe. -  advantage we have - They do not have a base in India and dont know the indian market very well.
What the slide should have: List of competitors
Competitive advantage

+Barriers to entry (knowhow required, niche space, advantage of tech, first mover advantage)
comment: Should ideally also compare India vs US vs Europe market in terms of:
- Type of trails
- Organization of adventure tourism industry

There by concluding why India market is unique + vast + requires its own solution
