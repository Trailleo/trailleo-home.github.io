HS comments: What do you mean by information? 
I see two things: 
1) Trek discovery - People don't know about the existing treks 
2) Trek guide - How/what/when of the trek
Things to write: Unorganised information, information related to treks is scattered and not easy to understand. Even when you decide to head outdoors.
Going outdoors is always going to be a risky activity as you will be facing nature in the rawest form.
Customers currently tackle this by using the bits of information present and hiring local guides to lead the trails
What the slide should have: Describe the pain points of customer.
How do they tackle it currently

comment: To make venturing into wilderness easier and safer for outdoor enthusiasts.
Easier - organise all the information needed to head outdoors and make it useful and accessible to all.
Safer - Use technology to make mountains safe
