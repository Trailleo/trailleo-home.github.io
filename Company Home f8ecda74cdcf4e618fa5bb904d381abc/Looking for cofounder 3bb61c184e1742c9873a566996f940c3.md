# Looking for cofounder

Hey guys!

I’m Nikhil, from the Goa 2010 batch. My cofounders [Shivalik](https://www.facebook.com/shivalik?fref=gs&__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARBWHW9kCO5T7-c8Ja8l4unkpPD1gj-BbZKvGAQiB8IsHVbFHxh_mb4Cswz9NYFdR5ALADTJTAa-Bbna&dti=220263411320988&hc_location=group), Arun, [Someshwar](https://www.facebook.com/someshwar.dash?fref=gs&__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARAFtqYqRSk1_yIrBcfu5bQ6NtLXq5_0jdogUDYfxiWWCb4wFgdE5emBDDeGCUqHnnDOd1tiJ0y_WvIy&dti=220263411320988&hc_location=group) and I (hostel mates from BITS Goa) got together last year to solve the hassle of driving your own car in city traffic by providing quality on-demand temporary drivers. In a matter of 3 months of operations, we were servicing 20-25 rides per day pan-Mumbai but had also stumbled upon a more pressing problem - there was no absolute metric for us to gauge our drivers’ performances while behind the wheel of a customer's car. This prompted us to start building what we’re working on today - Vahanalytics. Around that time, Driven was acquired by a bigger player, Driverskart, and we moved onto VA full-time.

Vahanalytics ([www.vahanalytics.com](http://www.vahanalytics.com/?fbclid=IwAR0lytdARWPQ9NSovD79trtzzy8qPYQbPvAbvq_NSKxnqkNCC7W4AJM0aw4)) is a data science company trying to create a world with better drivers and safer roads by leveraging big data and machine learning techniques. The product we’re building is very interesting and potentially groundbreaking and we believe it can change the face of the transportation industry. Here’s a little more on that story: [http://yourstory.com/2016/05/vahanalytics-funding/](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/vahanalytics-funding/?fbclid=IwAR1B-EZHJGobGVETmyuHkhcgbAGoaT5BR9Erg_CXSajQpP4hsmNkgnXHmk8)

We’re looking to put together a small, agile A-team that will shape our product and company over the coming months and years. So it goes without saying that we are looking for hustlers who are passionate about the work we’re doing here, can take the reins of their domain and can really share our vision for Vahanalytics. FIFA skills are a bonus!

Here are the profiles we are hiring for: [https://angel.co/va-urbtranz-technologies-pvt-ltd/jobs](https://angel.co/va-urbtranz-technologies-pvt-ltd/jobs?fbclid=IwAR1WPNbArruW2SXKh-epq5SD6mv0QMTnPkQ2_LUK21w9g2Dg7_10EOG_48w)

So if you fit the bill or have a friend who does, hit me up or apply directly on careers@vahanalytics.com!

Cheers

Hi All,

I'm Mihir Umarye, from BITSGoa 2010 batch. A bunch of us are trying to build an outdoor navigation app to simplify hiking in India. We are a  pre-MVP product startup who want to make venturing outdoors easier and safer for everyone. We believe it can change the face of the adventure tourism by nullifying the number of emergency incidents that occur in the great Himalayas and all other adventure destinations in India. 

We are looking for a technical co-founder to join us, someone with android app dev/react native experience and who is passionate about outdoors and nature. If you or anyone in your network is interested, do let us know. 

Cheers,

Mihir Umarye

Wander into the wilderness around you knowing you can always make an emergency call. Feel comfortable going solo.  Because getting to the top is optional but getting home is mandatory.
